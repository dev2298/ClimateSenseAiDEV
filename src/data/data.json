  "About": {
    "paragraph": "It is estimated that by 2050, half of the Indian population will be living in urban areas, thus expanding cities by 20-30%. This expansion creates a different set of problems like mass deforestation, habitat fragmentation, loss of flora, increased greenhouse gases (majorly CO2 whose percent has increased more than 25% in the past 5 decades) and disrupted annual whether cycle as seen by the 2024 heat wave.ClimateSense.Ai will solve this problem by making Ai-Powered PhotoBioReactors (first in India)as an alternative to trees – one of which captures the same amount of CO2  as two ten year old grown trees would or a 200 square meter lawn would do. We wish to provide nature that chance to thrive within urban setups providing space efficient with better air quality, aesthetic surroundings, and a profitable revenue model as well.",
    "Why": [
      "Reducing Indian carbon footprint and provide better urban air quality and do this all with a profitable revenue model.",
      "Make the brand and product a part of daily public life and make it synonymous with climate tech innovations."
    ],
    "Why2": [
      "Build a dedicated Ai Platform to serve wider needs in Climate Tech Field",
      "Become a major player in USD 300 Billion Biomass Food Supplement market"
